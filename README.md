# fantacalcio
Combination of ideas from different repos to create a tool to select the initial team and match squad per week in Fantacalcio.

# General idea
Use the data parsed and scoring from https://github.com/piopy/fantacalcio-py, combine it with the price prediction data parsed using https://github.com/giodavoli/fantacalcio-optimization and using the same repo, select an initial team.

Once the initial team has been selected, use the model in https://github.com/uPeppe/fantabeto to predict the best squad based on the players in the squad.
